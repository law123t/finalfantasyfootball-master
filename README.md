# FinalFantasyFootball

## Problem Statement
* In this project, I plan to address the problem of having the freedom to project and simulate football
teams. With this application users will be able to build teams freely and efficiently, without 
having to do multiple. time consuming drafts just to project season outcomes.

## Application Details
* This application will have 2 main functions; a function that allows free draft called "Sandbox Draft" and a stretch goal of a "Head to Head" application that allows for pulling other teams and simulating a season.

### Sandbox Draft
Allows for freeform teams, this gives freedom to users to create their own dream "super teams"
and to see how they fare against others

### Head To Head (Stretch Goal)
This is the application that allows users to simulate a head to head with a random team either
in the entire database, or thier own teams. Doing this will give stats on the simulated game. 
This part of the application will also allow for a "simulated season" option, that just runs
the simulation 16 times, giving only the total season points and amounts of wins and losses.

## Application Technologies
* Junit
* Maven
* Hibernate
* AWS
* JQuery (draggable droppable?)
* Tomcat & Tomee
* Java
* SQL</br>
